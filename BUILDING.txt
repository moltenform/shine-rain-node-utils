- Install node
- Open a terminal, `cd` to directory that contains `package.json`.
- Run `npm install`
- Because this is the first time running the app, run
    - `node app.js --startNewDbFile`
- Run
    - `npm run startserver`
    - you should now be able to open a browser window to
"http://localhost:8999" and see the website.

if you make js source code changes they will automatically reload the site for convenience.
if your changes are not showing up in the browser though, they might have been cached by the browser,
hitting ctrl+F5 (or using chrome tools to clear the siteâ€™s cache and then refreshing) should pick up the new changes.

see the scripts section of package.json for more scripts.

If you open the project in VSCode, there are some commands under Run and Debug,

- VSCode
    - Run the Lint command to run eslint.
    - Debug server code
        - Open the Run and Debug section on the left.
        - Run "Run Startserver Script W Debugger"
        - You can set breakpoints and step through the code.
    - Debug client code
        - Open the Run and Debug section on the left.
        - Run "Run Chrome W Debugger"
        - The Chrome Dev Tools is now attached to the VSCode instance.
        - You can set breakpoints and step through the code.

 Tested on node 20. If you are on windows and get gyp errors, install or update visual studio (or a windows sdk) so that there is a C/C++ compiler.
